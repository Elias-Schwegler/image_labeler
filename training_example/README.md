# Training Example

This folder contains a standalone example of how to use the dataset generated by Image Labeler to train a computer vision model.

## Prerequisites

This example utilizes **PyTorch**. To avoid bloating the main project, it has its own `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

1.  Create a separate virtual environment (recommended) or install into your existing one:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Assuming you have already run the Image Labeler (CLI or UI) and generated a split dataset in `data/processed`:

```bash
python train.py --data_dir ../data/processed --epochs 10
```

### What it does:

1.  **Loads Data**: Reads `train/numbers.json` and `test/labels.json` to find images and labels.
2.  **Discovers Classes**: Automatically identifying all unique labels in your training set.
3.  **Fine-tunes**: Retrains the last layer of a **ResNet18** model.
4.  **Saves**: Outputs `model.pth` and `class_map.json` to your data directory.

## Model
The script uses `ResNet18`, a lightweight and efficient model suitable for running on edge devices or CPUs.
